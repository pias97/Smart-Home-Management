# Smart-Home-Management
A simulation-based project was done by using Arduino for my University Course Microprocessor and Microcontroller  Laboratory.  To simulate this project one needs to have Arduino IDE and Proteus 8 Professional installed in his/her computer. Necessary Tools and Libraries are also uploaded here for download.
